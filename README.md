# Chocolate-analysis
The aim of this project is to analyse the various chocolate ratings using R and derive conclusions.
The project is divided into 3 stages: 
1. Data Cleaning : removing columns not used in analysis, converting have/have nots to boolean 0 and 1
2. Exploratory Analysis: understanding how the data varies, finding frequent entries for each column and finding out summary statistics
3. Questions and hypothesis testing: analysing the trends and finding out relations through regression and hypothesis testing.

This project was done as a part of the course BMAT202P, Probability and Statistics Lab in the year 2023
